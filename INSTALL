Installation Makefile Target
============================

    # make install

This command takes into account several environment variables:

  * PREFIX               default: /usr
  * DESTDIR              default:
  * BINDIR               default: $(PREFIX)/bin
  * LIBDIR               default: $(PREFIX)/lib
  * MANDIR               default: $(PREFIX)/share/man
  * BASHCOMPDIR          default: $(PREFIX)/share/bash-completion/completions
  * RUNSTATEDIR          default: /var/run
  * PKG_CONFIG           default: pkg-config

  * WITH_BASHCOMPLETION  default: yes
  * WITH_WGQUICK         default: yes

The first section is rather standard. The second section is not:

  * WITH_BASHCOMPLETION decides whether or not bash completion files for the
    tools are installed. This is just a nice thing for people who have bash.
    If you don't have bash, or don't want this, set the environment variable
    to `no'.

  * WITH_WGQUICK decides whether or not the wg-quick(8) script is installed.
    This is a very quick and dirty bash script for reading a few extra
    variables from wg(8)-style configuration files, and automatically
    configures the interface. If you don't have bash, you probably don't want
    this at all. Likewise, if you already have a working network management
    tool or configuration, you probably want to integrate wg(8) or the direct
    WireGuard API into your network manager, rather than using wg-quick(8).
    But for folks who like simple quick&dirty scripts, this is nice.
